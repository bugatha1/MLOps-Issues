Experiment contains Trials .. Trials contain trialcomponents.
Trial is execution of workflow - in model selection, we can check with XGBoost vs Random forest vs logistic regression (for each of this we need Trial.)
Trialcomponents are individual activity in the workflow (trialcomponent is a stage in the trial). It refers in preprocessing step ..like imputing, missig values
and normalizing data or whole preproessing step.

==================================

Taking care of missing data
# missing data filled with average/mean value

from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
imputer = SimpleImputer(missing_values=np.nan, strategy='mean')
imputer.fit(X[:, 1:3])
X[:, 1:3] = imputer.transform(X[:, 1:3])
print(X)
